__Project: CookingAPI (or ToDoList)__

Description:
    Create a cooking recipe/ingredient management API.
    Features:
        1. User Auth
        2. Recipe Management
            Create, update, delete recipes in user database
        3. Ingredient Management
            List ingredients across recipes
        4. (tentative) Shopping list:
            Ingredient list based on recipes

Purpose:
    1. Fundamentals - I want to learn how to build an API on my own
    2. Extendability - I can work on fullstack later by creating a React frontend
    3. Usefulness - If I actually extend the project, it sounds pretty useful to a college student like me

Tech stack:
    Python - FastAPI framework
    Database - PostgreSQL with SQLAlchemy
    PyJWT, Bcrypt for authentication/passwords
    Deployment - Docker
